## Security Considerations

### MCP Hub Integration

1. **Port Security**

   - The plugin communicates with MCP Hub on a local port
   - Default port (3000) can be configured
   - Only accepts connections from localhost
   - Ensure firewall rules don't expose the port externally

2. **Configuration Security**

   - Configuration files may contain sensitive data
   - Store config files with appropriate permissions
   - Don't commit configuration with secrets
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data

3. **Plugin Permissions**
   - Plugin runs with Neovim's permissions
   - Be cautious with file operations
   - Validate all paths before operations
   - Don't execute arbitrary commands
